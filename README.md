This README file guides us through the workflow of our study. The workflow consists of 3 major components. First, modulation data is generated through MATLAB. Then, FBT is implemented in MATLAB. CT and RF are trained in R. Finally, predicitive performance is verified for each model.

### Modulation Simulation
The code that performs the simulation is in ["code/Modulation"](https://github.com/kenlau177/MSC_Project/tree/master/code/Modulation).

In particular, ["code/Modulation/main_simulation_all.m"](https://github.com/kenlau177/MSC_Project/blob/master/code/Modulation/main_simulation_all.m) script is automated to simulate the modulation data. Note that MATLAB's Communication Toolbox is required.

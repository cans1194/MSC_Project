This README file guides us through the workflow of our study. The workflow consists of 3 major components. 
First, data is generated through MATLAB. Then, we use R and MATLAB to train each model.
Finally, we verify the predictive performance of each model using ggplot2 in R.

### Modulation Simulation
All the code that performs the simulation is in [code/Modulation](https://github.com/kenlau177/MSC_Project/tree/master/code/Modulation).

In particular, [code/Modulation/main_simulation_all.m](https://github.com/kenlau177/MSC_Project/blob/master/code/Modulation/main_simulation_all.m) script is automated to simulate all the data. Note that MATLAB's Communication Toolbox is required.
